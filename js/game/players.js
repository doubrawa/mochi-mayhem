/* Player entity: position is in TILE coordinates as floats.
   The hitbox is a centered AABB smaller than a tile so players can squeeze
   between corners when aligned, just like classic Bomberman.

   Movement:
   - Direction comes from the input system as (dx, dy) each in {-1,0,1}.
   - We try the X axis and the Y axis separately, snapping back when blocked.
     This produces natural wall-sliding without diagonal cheats.
   - When only one axis is pressed, we softly nudge the player toward the
     center of the perpendicular axis, so they don't get stuck on corners. */
